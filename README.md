Even though there is not any real user interaction with this component, I wanted to add in a few accessibility features. For example, even though the icons do not actually have any function, I made them focusable and added hover states. The icons are enclosed in a menu tag to portray an options menu rather than a div.

### Useful resources

- [MDN web docs: animation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation) - This helped me with making sure I understood the options correctly for the CSS animation property. The article on keyframes was also helpful.
